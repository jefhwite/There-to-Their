# there-to-their
 
Confound your friends and frustrate your foes with "There to Their," my first-ever extension. It forces a very common spelling mistake in your browser by swapping the word "there" with "their." Install the extension, and marvel as even our most heralded publications like the New York Times to Reddit to an email from your English major friend begin to write with the embarrassing typos.

I built this extension as a small side project that would help me learn some basics in programming. I borrowed heavily (almost completely) from Steven Frank's famed "Cloud to Butt" extension, so my extreme gratitude goes to him. As soon as I learn how, I hope to bring some new features to this extension... There to their to.... they're? The possibilities are endless. :) ï»¿
